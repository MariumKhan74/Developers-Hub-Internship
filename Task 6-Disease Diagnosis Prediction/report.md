# Diabetes Prediction and Risk Mitigation Using PIMA Indians Diabetes Dataset

## üöÄ Objective

The goal of this project is to predict the likelihood of diabetes in individuals based on medical data provided in the PIMA Indians Diabetes Dataset. The model aims to support healthcare professionals in early detection and intervention for diabetic patients.

## üóÇ Dataset Description

The dataset used for this analysis is the **PIMA Indians Diabetes Dataset**, which contains medical data for female patients. It includes the following features:

- **Pregnancies**: Number of pregnancies the patient has had.
- **Glucose**: Plasma glucose concentration after 2 hours in an oral glucose tolerance test.
- **BloodPressure**: Diastolic blood pressure (mm Hg).
- **SkinThickness**: Skinfold thickness (mm).
- **Insulin**: 2-Hour serum insulin (mu U/ml).
- **BMI**: Body mass index (weight in kg/(height in m)^2).
- **DiabetesPedigreeFunction**: A function that scores the likelihood of diabetes based on family history.
- **Age**: Age of the patient in years.
- **Outcome**: Whether the patient has diabetes (1) or not (0).

The dataset consists of 768 rows and 9 features, with the goal of predicting the **Outcome** variable.

## üîÑ Preprocessing Steps

Before training the models, the following preprocessing steps were performed:

1. **Feature Scaling**: Features such as `Glucose`, `BMI`, and `Age` were scaled using **StandardScaler** to ensure that all features contribute equally to the model.
3. **Train-Test Split**: The dataset was split into training and testing sets using an 80/20 split to evaluate model performance.

## üßë‚Äçüî¨ Models Implemented

The following machine learning models were trained and evaluated:

1. **Support Vector Machine (SVM)**: A robust model used for classification tasks.
2. **Gradient Boosting**: A model that builds trees sequentially, with each tree correcting the errors of the previous one.
3. **Neural Network**: A deep learning model that can capture complex non-linear relationships.

### **Rationale for Model Selection**
- **SVM**: Ideal for smaller datasets with clear decision boundaries.
- **Gradient Boosting**: Used for its strong predictive power in classification problems.
- **Neural Network**: Applied for its ability to capture complex patterns in the data.

## üìä Key Insights and Visualizations

Based on the trained models, the following key insights were derived:

### üîç Key Risk Indicators

#### 1. **Glucose Levels**
- **Most influential** predictor of diabetes.
- Elevated glucose levels are consistently associated with a **higher probability of diagnosis**.
- **Recommendation**: Implement regular **glucose monitoring**, especially for patients with borderline levels.

#### 2. **Body Mass Index (BMI)**
- High BMI values **strongly correlate** with diabetes onset.
- Indicates that **obesity is a major contributing factor**.
- **Recommendation**: Prioritize **weight management programs** and **lifestyle counseling** for patients with high BMI.

#### 3. **Age**
- The likelihood of developing diabetes **increases with age**.
- Middle-aged and elderly patients show a **significantly higher risk**.
- **Recommendation**: Begin routine **diabetes screening earlier** for individuals with additional risk factors (e.g., family history, sedentary lifestyle).

#### 4. **Number of Pregnancies**
- Patients with more pregnancies showed **slightly higher susceptibility**.
- May reflect underlying **metabolic changes** during and after pregnancy.
- **Recommendation**: Monitor **glucose tolerance** in women with a history of **gestational diabetes** or **multiple pregnancies**.

#### 5. **Insulin and Skin Thickness**
- Contributed less to predictive power, possibly due to **missing or inconsistent values**.
- **Recommendation**: Ensure **consistent collection** and **higher data quality** for these clinical features to support more robust screening models.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Model Evaluation

The models were evaluated using the following metrics:
- **Accuracy**
- **F1 Score**
- **AUC-ROC** (Area Under the Receiver Operating Characteristic Curve)

### **Performance Evaluation**
The **F1 Score** and **AUC-ROC** were computed for each model to assess the trade-off between precision and recall, and to measure the overall performance of the model in distinguishing between the classes.

### **Challenges Faced**
1. **Imbalanced Dataset**: The dataset had a higher number of non-diabetic patients compared to diabetic patients. Solutions included using stratified sampling and evaluating models with metrics such as **F1 Score** and **AUC-ROC**.
2. **Missing or Inconsistent Data**: Some features such as **Insulin** and **SkinThickness** had missing or inconsistent values. This was mitigated by data imputation or removal of rows with excessive missing data.
3. **Model Interpretability**: Some models like **Neural Networks** and **Gradient Boosting** are harder to interpret. Techniques like **SHAP** and **LIME** were used for model explainability.

## üß† General Healthcare Recommendations

- **Early Detection**  
  Use predictive tools to flag **high-risk individuals** before symptoms arise, enabling **proactive care**.

- **Personalized Care Plans**  
  Integrate **risk scores** into Electronic Health Records (EHRs) to create **tailored intervention plans**.

- **Community Outreach**  
  Target **at-risk populations** with educational programs on **lifestyle modification, nutrition, and physical activity**.

- **Continuous Monitoring**  
  Adopt **wearable technology** or **at-home glucose monitoring** for high-risk individuals to improve **long-term health outcomes**.

## üìö Conclusion

The diabetes prediction model demonstrated that **glucose levels**, **BMI**, and **age** are the most significant predictors of diabetes in the dataset. These insights can be leveraged by healthcare professionals to implement **early screening**, **targeted interventions**, and **lifestyle modification** programs for high-risk individuals. This model can serve as a useful tool for improving patient outcomes and reducing the long-term health burden of diabetes.
